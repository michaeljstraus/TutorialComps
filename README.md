**Hello data analyzers**

Looks like you've stumbled across the Solar Panel Data Analysis Git Repository. It contains both solar data and a python notebook to interpret all of that information. The end goal here is to determine what variables are the most indicative of solar output. This will make it so that when I build my machine learning model, I can adjust my irradiance, temperature, and alternating current variables accordingly.

**Setup**

There are two ways to use the tutorial above. One is using your local machine, and assumes you have many libraries such as Numpy and Matplotlib installed. The alternative recommended way involves making a copy of the attached Google Colab file that you can adjust as necessary

*Option 1*

1. You will first want to clone this repository on to your computer. This can be done by typing git clone into the command line while you are in a valid repository. More details [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
