**Hello Solar Panel Data Analyzers**

Looks like you've stumbled across the Solar Panel Data Analysis Git Repository. It contains both solar data and a python notebook to interpret all of that information. The end goal here is to determine what variables are the most indicative of solar output. This will make it so that when I build my machine learning model, I can adjust my irradiance, temperature, and alternating current variables accordingly.

**Setup**

There are two ways to use the tutorial above. One is using your local machine, and assumes you have many libraries such as Numpy and Matplotlib installed. The alternative recommended way involves making a copy of the attached Google Colab file that you can adjust as necessary
*Option 1 (Google Colab) **Recommended** *
*Option 2 (Jupyter Notebooks)*

1. You will first want to clone the above repository on to your computer. This can be done by typing git clone into the command line while you are in a valid repository. More details [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
2. Then, search online for how to use and get the following libraries on your PC (if they are not already installed):
    1. Matplotlib
    2. Seaborn
    3. StatsModels
    4. SciPy
    5. HoloViews (Extension Bokeh)
    6. Cufflinks
    7. Jupyter Notebooks
3. Open the .ipynb in Jupyter Notebooks. For how to do that, visit [this Jupyter Notebooks tutorial](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html). 
4. Run the code. If it's your first time using Jupyter, you can run the notebook using [this](https://docs.qubole.com/en/latest/user-guide/notebooks-and-dashboards/notebooks/jupyter-notebooks/running-jupy-notebooks.html) series of commands - Run, and then Run All. You should see the same results, graphs, files etc pop up as was saved in the notebook, but now you can adapt the Python file to fit your needs. Running any block can be done with shift enter
